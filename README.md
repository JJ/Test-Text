Plot outline
---------------

After America is defeated by a technologically superior Cuba and
Spain, Florida becomes an independent multiracial socialist state
which is inmediately at war with the (now diminished) America. 

An American Pinkerton agent is sent into that state to recover a
*mechanical man* that has been seen in a circus doing gigs from
Pensacola to St. Pitersburg entertaining the masses. 

He succeeds, but going back to Washington is not easy. He becomes a
railway hobo, accompanied with a hobo cyborg - the hoborg of the title.

How you can help
-----------------------

After four paragraphs, you might have already realized English is not my
main language. Sending me corrections  is not the only way you can help

* You can just
  [follow @hoborg_novel on Twitter](http://twitter.com/hoborg_novel)
  or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ManuelTheMagnificent) and interact with it.
* Get a [GitHub account](http://github.com).
* Watch, star or fork this repo. You don't need to do anything else.
   for the time being, but it will help me achieve some visibility.
* You can interact with the text and the rest directly from the web:
  you can comment on text and changes in it (called *commits*).
* You can also request changes on the text using [*issues*](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues). If you find
  an error of any kind, just raise an issue and I'll fix it (or try
  to).
* Create your own version: once forked, you can use git (check out
  this manual http://wiki.freegeek.org/index.php/Git_for_dummies ) to
  branch and evolve the story in whicheer way you want.
* You can keep it (hey, it's free as in free speech) or, if you think
  it's a worthwhile addition to Hoborg, do a Pull Request.
* [Check out the TODO list](TODO.md) in case you find something that
  you could do yourself. 

Full disclosure
------------------

When the novel is roughly finished (that is, it's got an ending, it
will actually never be finished since it might evolve in time) I
intend to publish it in Amazon.com. Since all your contributions will
be here, in the repo, they are obviously acknowledged, but I'll
acknowledge it also in the prologue itself and, if I earn enough to be
able to physically print it and mail it, will mail you a copy. That's
quite unlikely to happen, however, so I'll make a promise I can keep:
to follow you in Twitter.

Start reading and participating
---------------------------------------

Just go to [the novel](text/text.md). You can also [read about the characters](text/characters.md), although doing so might result in spoilerage, or about the [geography of the Republic of Florida](text/geography.md).

How this can help
-----------------------

Read the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) to get your very own novel going in Github. 

Navigating the repository
---------------------------------

You already know the [text](text/README.md) directory, which contains
the novel text itself as well as scraps we might need for
later. [resources](resources/README.md) contains HTML templates,
images and other non-text stuff. [apps](apps/README.md) includes
conversion scripts and other mainly Perl scripts I use for managing
this. [Text-Hoborg](Text-Hoborg/README) contains a Perl module that is
used for testing and continuous integration and might eventually
contain the novel itself and be released that way. 

Get in touch
---------------

If it is some issue related to the novel, [use the GitHub
issues](https://github.com/JJ/hoborg/issues), any other business, just
[email me](mailto:hoborg@merelo.net).
