=head1 NAME

Test::Text - A module for testing text files. 


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Test::Text version 0.1.1


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Test::Text;

    my $dir = "path/to/text_dir"; 
    my $data = "path/to/data_dir"; 

    my $tesxt = new Test::Text $text_dir, $dict_dir; # Defaults to English: en_US and all files

    $tesxt = new Test::Text $text_dir, $dict_dir, "en_US", $this_file, $that_file; # Tests only those files 

    $tesxt = new Test::Text $text_dir, $dict_dir, "es_ES"; # Uses alternate language 

    $testxt->check(); # spell-checks plain or markdown text in that dir or just passed

    just_check( $dir, $data ); # Exported by default, procedural interface
    $testxt->done_testing(); # all over and out


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This started as a spell and quality check for my novel, "Manuel the
Magnificent Mechanical Man". Eventually, it can be used for checking
any kind of markdown-formatted text, be it fiction or non-fiction. The first version included
as documentation, the novel itself (check it out at L<Text::Hoborg::Manuel> and also in the test
directory the markdown source. 

This module is a more general text-tester (that's a C<tesxter>) which can be used on any external set of texts.  
This all came from the idea that L<writing is like software development|https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/6d154a43719c>, which I'm using throughout. 

You will need to install Hunspell and any dictionary you will be using. By default, Hunspell only installs English and a few more (would be hard pressed to tell which ones)

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 new $text_dir, $data_dir [, $language = 'en_US'] [,  @files]

Creates an object with link to text and markdown files identified by
    extension.  There is no default for
    the dir since it is supposed to be external. If an array of files
    is given, only those are used and not all the files inside the
    directory; these files will be prepended the C<$text_dir> to get
    the whole path. 

=head2 files

Returns the files it will be checking.

=head2 dir

Returns the dir the source files are in. Since this is managed from the
object, it is useful for other functions.

=head2 check

Check files. This is the only function you will have to call from from your test script.

=head2 just_check $text_dir, $data_dir [, $language = 'en_US'] [,  @files]

Everything you need in a single function. The first directory will
    include text and auxiliary directory files, the second main
    dictionary and suffix files. By default all C<*.md> files will be
    checked. Basically equivalent to the creation of an object followed by C<$ob->check()>  

=head2 done_testing

Called after all tests have been performed.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

Test::Text requires L<Text::Hunspell> and the 
C<en_US> dictionnary for C<hunspell>, which you can install with
C<sudo apt-get install hunspell-en-us>, but since I found no way of expressing this
dependency within Makefile.PL, I have added it to the C<data> dir,
mainly. Latest version requires L<Test::Builder>. It also includes the
    C<es> dictionnary in the latest version, also included. If you
    need any other file, check previously that it's in the
    C</usr/share/hunspell> dir, but since this module is mainly
    intended to be used for CI, I had rather include these files in
    the distro. 

=head1 Development and bugs

Development of this module is hosted at L<GitHub|http://github.com/JJ/Test-Text>. Use it for forking, bug reports, checking it out, whatever
