A bit of geography
==================

The All Races Republic of Florida comprises the whole former American
state of Florida, plus a bit of buffer zones that were conquered
during the Patriotic Wars from the hands of the capitalist
serfs. These buffer zones extend, in the West, up to Pascagoula (in
the former American state of Mississippi) and in
the East up to Brunswick. The Northern and heavily guarded border
extends in a rough straight line from Brunswick to Atmore, including
Valdosta and other formerly American towns and cities that have, by
themselves or with a bit of help, embraced the revolution. 

The capital city was moved to the well-guarded city of Tampa from
early on in the Patriotic Guard and now is a bastion that no
capitalist Army will ever be able to contest. 

More than two and a half million people live happily here, under the
guidance of the Patriotic Council led by Monday Cudjo, an Estelusti
with a Spanish grandmother whose wiseness arises from his blood that
mixes all the races of this new Florida: Seminole, Negro and
Spanish. Let him guide our people and free us from all threats.
