#Introducing a bit of code

~~~
document.writeln('Hello world');
console.log('Written '+window.location.href);
~~~

And maybe another language

~~~Perl
use strict;
use warnings;
my $foo = $bar;
~~~

This would be a variable definition `var foo=bar`

And this would be somewhat more code

```
my $zipi = zape;
```
