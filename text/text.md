Persons that don't actually wait for trains
========================

He was already standing at the edge of the station bench when I
arrived. That struck me as odd, since he was actually, physically,
taking an space that could have been better leveraged by sitting on
it. Marking a bench slot, but not using it. Maybe out of wanting to
exercise himself, even mildly. Something he seemed to be needing
badly, since he was candle-shaped and slouching. Maybe to compensate,
or just because, he was balancing slightly on his heels. 

He continued doing so when I boarded the train and it left the
station. He was, at that moment, the only person left at the station.
