    * lib/Test/Text.pm: Start to work with more extensions


0.6.5   2020-10-??  JMERELO
    * switch from File::Slurp::Tiny to Path::Tiny
    * Reformatted Changes as per CPAN::Changes::Spec

0.6.4   2020-10-10  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: 0.6.4 includes multi-line markdown links.

0.6.3   2020-09-21  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Changes again so that it can be called
      with or without calling done_testing.

0.6.2   2020-09-21  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: New version eliminates done_testing from the check;
      this will break a few things, I'm afraid... 
    * Added optional done_testing with a 4th argument to just_check.
      It's on by default, can be turned off.

0.6.1   2019-10-31  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Latest version includes Text::Sentence
      (taken from HTML::Summary) to avoid installation of all dependencies
      in that module.

0.4.2   2017-07-28  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Shows correctly (apparently) utf-8 encoded characters.

0.4.0   2016-04-20  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Strips code from markdown to avoid getting
	  bogged down by it. 

0.3.0   2015-12-20  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm (check): Strips URL to avoid oh so many
	  non-dict words to creep up in the text. 

0.1.8   2014-08-16  JMERELO
    * lib/Test/Text.pm: Many patches from Gabor Szabo
      and eliminated File::Slurp dependency.
    * Also suppressed legacy "uses"

0.1.7   2014-08-13  JMERELO
	* t/02.just_check.t: Added this since it's got an independent done_testing
	* lib/Test/Text.pm (just_check): Finished tests and changed encoding
      for test script.

0.1.6   2014-08-12  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm (check): Adds more strict extraction of words
	  to avoid some Spanish sigils; changes tests to account for that.
	  (check): getting rid of old regexes and using proper Unicode for
               version 0.1.5

0.1.3   2014-08-11  JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Adds a few Spanish symbols to avoid UTF8 errors
      and corrects the Spanish affix file to avoid warnings. 

0.1.2   2014-08-10   JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm (done_testing): Managed to make it work with
	  UTF8 dictionaries, passing now tests. Will try to use it in actual
	  CI for my latest book

0.1.0   2014-08-08   JMERELO
	* lib/Test/Text.pm: Added text and data for Spanish.

    * Initial release.
